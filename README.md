# **Nebby's Better PBR-**

 

A **Minecraft Resource Pack** that adds numerous **Optifine** features and **Normal** and **Specular** textures.

This is to recreate the feel of playing **RTX** like textures in **Minecraft Java Edition.**

This Resource Pack is in development, some blocks are missing...


 

## General Information:

What does this pack do? What is used to create these Effects

     This Pack Works on the basis of the LabPBR standard. What’s that?
     will add the wiki


## How Do I use This Pack? What are the recommended Shaders?


In order to use this pack's features to the fullest, you must use Shaders.
The Shaders I recommend are:
Complementary Shaders- by Emin
Nostalgia- by RRe36
BSL- by Capt Tatsu
MollyVX and Raspberry- by Rutherin

SEUS PTGI and other path traced shaders work wonders and have armour and entity support so the mobs have PBR too
But being Path Traced they can be heavy sometimes and may cause lag- unless you have a really cool GPU.

 


## Rules Of The Pack:

The Rules are pretty simple:

You Can:
Use it in Youtube Videos and link the Curseforge link in the description.
Use it in YT let’s plays
